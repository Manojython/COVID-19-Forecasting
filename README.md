# Research question:  
With the upcoming rise in the global pandemic, we try to predict the upcoming number of cases which could be confirmed for a specific date. We also plan to predict the region across which the number of cases can increase. With our knowledge, we take on a challenging problem to solve a global case of emergency.
# Domain and Data: 
The domain of the data is Healthcare or more precisely diseases classification.
The dataset contains cumulative and non-cumulative count of confirmed, death and recovered global cases of COVID-19 (upto March 14, 2020), we expect the data to be populated again.
The dataset consists of 70K rows approximately

## Preprocessing that may be necessary:
This is a Kaggle dataset mostly clean and doesnt require much preprocessing.

## size of data - data must be “big” data (millions of records)

## tentative plan for analysis on GCP

#### EDA and Preprocessing

#### Dashboard for User group, Dashboard for Data Engineers

#### GCP further processing - ML

#### Evaluation of results

#### Steps for production model

#### Final Dashboard for User Group
